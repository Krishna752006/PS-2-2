We're building a smart AI coding assistant for VS Code, providing real-time code suggestions, autocompletions, and intelligent snippets. Simply type a prompt, and it generates context-aware code in seconds.

This extension boosts developer productivity by offering AI-driven coding assistance and flawless VS Code integration for faster, smarter development.

Through this project we shall be learn to Automate processes, create an AI-Powered Code Generation, learn to create plugins, Utilization of GPUs efficiently and real time AI Optimization.


Hugging Face will be of help -> Need to research
We shall be using Deepseek AI as the model --> Need to read the research paper

PyTorch vs TensorFlow?
For research & experimentation: PyTorch (Need to use this as Deepseek is build on it)
For production & deployment: TensorFlow (better tools for scaling & serving)

Link of DeepSeek Research Paper -> https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.14196

Backend to be completed till April 28,2025

Current Approach Planned (Need to find a better Approach):
By February 2025 end -> Front-End Website Should End
By April 28,2025 -> Backend to be completed 

Mahesh, Triveni, Sneha -> Front-End
KC, Lokesh -> Back-End
Aasrith -> Wild Card

Front-End Lead -> Sneha
Back-end Lead -> KC

Sri Pooja Mam Advised not to make a website but it is not a huge task and a good approach so till we finalize a better approach we shall stick to it.
